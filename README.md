# MainCode
This is the main code for the project by Jack Jowers, Braden Bell, and Jeb Holt.
Our project is an automated plant care system, it monitors the moisture of the soil, and the ambient humidity and temperature to make it easier to care for your plant. When the soil moisture drops below a certian threshold the water pump will turn on until the soil has reached its desired value.
